# Solana Pay Tools Demo

This is a proof-of-concept showing how to generate Solana Pay QR codes for P2P and small business payments.

Features:
- Generate payment links
- Track basic transactions
- Open-source and extendable

Future Plans:
- Full merchant dashboard
- Integration with USDG
- Easy-to-use CLI tools

This demo is part of my grant proposal for building practical Solana Pay tools for real-world usage.
